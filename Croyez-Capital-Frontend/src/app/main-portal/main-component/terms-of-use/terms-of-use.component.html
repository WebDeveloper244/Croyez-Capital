                        The Terms of Use will be governed by and construed and

                        without regard to conflicts of law principles. The

                        except with regard to injunctive relief. No person shall
                        bring a putative or certified class action to
                        arbitration nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute
                        arbitration agreement against any person who has
                        initiated a putative class action in court or who is a
                        member of a putative class who has not opted out of the
                        class with respect to any claims encompassed by the
                        putative class action until: (i) the class certification
                        is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii)
                        the customer is excluded from the class by the court.
                        Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate
                        shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under the

                        time without your consent. You may not assign the Terms
                        of Use or delegate any of your obligations under the
                        Terms of Use. Any purported assignment of the Terms of
                        Use in violation of the Terms of Use is void. If any
                        provision of the Terms of Use is found invalid or
                        unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the
